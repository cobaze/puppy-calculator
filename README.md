CODE PLAN

My program is a dog age calculator that converts dog age into human age.

When a user inputs the dog's age, the program takes the input via a form. The user will then submit this input using a button. Clicking the button activates the function that handles the calculation which then outputs what the dog's age is in human age.

In the calculation function, when the input is received, the number is subtracted from 2017 and then the answer is set to what the dog age is based on the dog age chart. For example, If the answer is 15, the output is set to one This is the answer (output) the user will get.
